# HokmIn5
A programming solution to choosing a better "Hokm" for the game Hokm (also known as Piece in Court)

This program is designed to help the "Hakem" of the game to choose a better "Hokm"
So, in this game, if you're not the Hakem, you probably don't need this program to help you out during the game (unless you just like to see the output of the game after Hakem announces the Hokm for that round. To see your team's probable chance of winning).

So, basically you just have to run the program (that has no UI for now)
and it needs the Hakem of the game to enter it's first-five-card hand (this hand is for deciding and choosing the Hokm of that round of the game)

**example input: ace of heart, queen of club, king of diamond, jack of heart, ace of club**
**as you can see, for the suits, you shouldn't use plural**

after the input is analyzed, the output would be 4 percentage-indicated data that shows choosing which suit as the Hokm of the game has better chance (percentage) of being well distributed for
the Hakem and his/her teammate.

**example outout: (43.2% spade, 22.9% heart, 19.3% club, 14.6% diamond)**
**each suit has a percentage before it, the more the number of the percentage, the better that suit is to be chosen as the Hokm of that round (in sense of being well distributed for Hakem's team**
**NOTE: these percentages indicates the best distribution of Hokms among Hakem's team only, and DO NOT inidicate the winning chance of that rounnd**

ENJOY!
